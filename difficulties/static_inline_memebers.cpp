// inline is used mostly with static vae in a header to avoid multiple difinition across different translation units
// in C++17 and later, constexpr variables are implicitly inline if they are defined inside a class or in a header file.

    static const int i = 10; // works because integral and enumeration static constants inside a class are treated as compile-time constants and donâ€™t require an out-of-class definition

    static std::array<int, 3> arr2; 
    // constexpr std::array<int, 3> arr1; // ERROR: because it's going to be instantiated and you are not allowed to have multiple constexpr memory allocation, just once
    static inline std::array<int, 3> arr3 { 2, 3, 4 }; // like out decl with inline so that it can be used in differrent translation units without odr violation. constexpr makes it implicitly inline as well
